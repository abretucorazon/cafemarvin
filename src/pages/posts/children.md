> *To all children, young and old*

\
Every child comes into the world carrying within themselves a unique code encrypted in their DNA. During childhood they have a mission to “crack” this code in order to unleash their natural talent, and subsequently as an adult, to make a contribution to the world by exercising this talent.

This may sound fairly common sense so far, what remains a mystery is the exact process that would allow children to “crack” their code. This journey begins with the search for the answers to the three following questions:

1. Where is my place in the world? (Explore)
2. What is my contribution to the world? (Create)
3. Who are my people? (Collaborate)

\
**Explore**\
A child needs to find their place in the world as they are growing up. It will be the kind of environment that will allow them to be productive and happy. It will support and nurture their natural talent. To this end, children need to venture out to explore the world around them, to experience diversity, and the multitude of different settings, venues, and environments that the world offers. For example, indoors vs outdoors, urban or country side, fast-paced or steady flow, creative vs analytical, high altitude or open water, office or home-based….

\
**Create**\
Second to exploring to learn about the world is the process of learning about oneself through the act of creating that would begin with the most simple projects such as baking a pie then gradually moving up to larger and more involved projects in different areas of expertise: arts and crafts, computer programming, electronics, etc….pretty much everything kids do in kindergarten are creative projects to create some type of objects. By pursuing creative projects in a wide variety of areas allows children to discover their natural abilities and personal interests. Some child is more physical while others are more artistic, or posses manual dexterity, or an affinity for numbers.

\
**Collaborate**\
In order to make a contribution to the world children need to collaborate with others since individually they could not accomplish much by themselves. By collaborating with others, a child will learn to build relationship and, as a result, will discover the types of people they can work well with, a community of people they admire and aspire to become. Finally, collaborative projects are great ways to find a compatible romantic partner, and to build a lasting happy relationship.\

**Learning**\
Unlike schooling which, with a few exceptions, is centred around these activities: readings, drills, and tests. This process results in the memorization of theories, it is commonly called knowledge. Meanwhile, very little understanding, let alone an appreciation for these theories took place. In contrast, an understanding of a subject matter followed by appreciation and insight happen when children explore, create, and collaborate, it is though these activities that real learning actually happens. And my definition of real learning is when it changes a person’s life in some measurable way after that person has learned something new. This Mark Twain’s quote: “The man who does not read has no advantage over the man who cannot read"–is a parallel to this concept of real learning. This seminal TED Talk by Sir Ken Robinson is an inspirational shock for everyone interested in the areas of children learning and education: <http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity>

\
**Culture**\
This is also a basis for an new youth culture founded on creative pursuits and making a contribution to the world as opposed to that of consumption and entitlement. Instead of personal assets or entitlement, it is the ability to create value and to contribute that matters.

\
**Happiness**\
It’s interesting to note that this process of discovery of a child’s natural talent and to nurture this talent in order for them to exercise it later on to make their personal contribution to the world–is also a recipe for living a happy meaningful and productive life, in the absence of self-doubt, or confusion, or worse to fight against one’s own nature to fit into someone else shoes: a complete waste of time, energy and untapped natural talent. In contrast, it is a deep sense of satisfaction, fulfillment, and personal power to exercise one’s natural talent to make a positive impact on the world.

\
**Parents**\
Parents want the best future for their children, they want them to grow into healthy, successful, and happy adults who will make their parents proud. All the hard works and sacrifices parents made to provide their children with the best education in order to prepare them to go after the best opportunities with the highest chance to become successful. This reasoning has created generations of increasingly wealthier, well-educated professionals who are also increasingly discontented with their lives which, they find, devoid of meaning and purpose other than the accumulation of personal wealth. There are a few people who, in their pursuit of success, accidentally stumbled on meaning and happiness in their lives, they are the exceptions to the norm that they, themselves, don’t know how did it happen.

Parents!!! What if we turn the table around to educate and prepare young children for the pursuit of meaning and happiness instead? So that wealth and fame will happen more like an accident then a destination…. Would you rather see your children grow into productive adults who lead a more meaningful and happier life? You can accomplish this end by throwing your support behind your child’s self-discovery process, and to help them to nurture and to exercise their natural talents for the greater good.

\
**Adults**\
Your mom’s advice that you heard in your childhood are still valid, for examples, she told you to eat your vegetables when you were little, you should eat your vegetables today as an adult. She told you to hold hand when you cross the street, you still should hold hand when you cross the street today except it is no longer her hand but someone else’s hand…. Similarly, if you have not “cracked” the code as a child to unleash your natural talent, as an adult you still can accomplish this feast using the same process of self-discovery:
