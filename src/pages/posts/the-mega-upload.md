Once upon a road trip...



**Marvin**: Once I asked a girl in her early 20’s, “what do people take with them when they die?” She was puzzled, thought about it for a little while and then replied: “a legacy.” Do you guys know?

**Al**: Never thought about it.

**Bob**: No idea. It’s not a legacy?

**Marvin**: Legacy is something you leave behind, not something you take with you.

**Al**: I don’t know and I don’t care.

**Bob**: It’s boring.

**Marvin**: Ok, how about when you go on a trip and after all the time you spend and all the things you do on that trip, what is left of them after you go home?\[[MORE]]

**Bob**: I went hiking on the Rocky mountains and there was a sign on the trail that said: “*Leave only footprint. Take only memories*.”

**Al**: Is it memories?

**Marvin**: Yes, after all the time you spend doing all the things you do in life and all the experiences you have, what is left are the memories you will take with you when you die.

**Al**: Wicked!

**Bob**: It’s depressing.

**Al**: Yeah.

**Marvin**: The idea is to collect a great many good memories when you are alive to take with you when you die…

**Bob**: Oh!

**Al**: Pretty deep!

**Marvin**: …when people die they see their life flashing before their eyes—that’s “**The Mega-Upload**" of their memories…

**Al**: Spooky!

**Bob**: Mmm…

**Marvin**: It’s like Bitcoin, do you know Bitcoin?

**Bob**: The crypto-currency?…

**Al**: …You can run a software to make Bitcoins that you can use to buy things. But you need a very fast computer because it takes a long time to make Bitcoins.

**Marvin**: That’s right! It takes a lot of heavy number crunching and a long time for the computer to make Bitcoins. That’s why they called it “Bitcoin mining.”

**Bob**: We know Bitcoins but what does it have to do with dying?

**Marvin**: I think good memories are the currency in Heaven and you will be rich in Heaven if you have collected a lot of good memories when you are alive…

**Al**: Ah, I got it! Collecting good memories all your life is like Bitcoin mining.

**Bob**: Hey, smart ass!

**Al**: You, dumb ass!

**Bob**: Shut up!… What if you don’t get to go to Heaven? What if you have to go to Hell? Can you still buy stuffs with good memories?

**Marvin**: Good question.

**Al**: Hah! You’re not a dumb ass, but not a smart ass either.

**Marvin**: Mmm… I don’t think you need any currency in Hell…

**Bob**: No?… How do you buy stuffs in Hell?

**Al**: Yeah!

**Marvin**: Because everything in Hell is free! Ha! Ha! Ha!… (LoL)

**Bob**: Bull shit! … You don’t know anything about Heaven or Hell…

**Al**: Yeah, that’s true! You are not dead yet! How do you know what is like in Heaven?

**Bob**: You are bullshitting us!

**Marvin**: “*If this be error and upon me proved, I never writ, nor no man ever loved*”

**Bob**: What does that mean?

**Al**: Is that French?

**Marvin**: *(sigh)…* Sonnet 116

**Bob**: Sonnet?…

**Al**: ???

**Marvin**: Look it up.
