I had a thought over this Valentine's Day:

"All you need is... "To Love"

It is a twist of a classic Beatles' song: "All you need is love." 

Why messing with an iconic pop culture mantra, you ask?

 My answer is part, to catch a free ride on its popularity, and part: evolution, that is to improve on a well-established cultural icon. Pretentious indeed. A word of caution: do not underestimate the imagination of a layperson, no one is yet able to size the vastness of a person's imagination. Or, could imagine the mighty power of one single word: "to", in this case.

How does this word affect this classic icon? 

Everything!

For one, it transforms "love" from a noun into a verb, in another word, "love" was an object, and is now an action. It is no longer a possession to covet like "Precious" in Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings. "Love" becomes an action to be exercised. More importantly, "love" is no longer a mystical possession to go searching for out there in the whole wide world. It is a superpower lying dormant in everyone's heart waiting to be awaken, like "The Force" of the Jedis in "Star Wars." 

So do not go looking for love, you will not find it out there. It is within you,...

all you need is "To Love".
