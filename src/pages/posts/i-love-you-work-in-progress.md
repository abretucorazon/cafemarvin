Do you make new year resolutions? I do at the end of December each year, after reviewing the resolutions I made the year before. For 2021, one of my resolution is to bring love back into the mainstream discourse. Do you think the world needs more love in our time? I do! And I notice love has mostly disappeared from popular culture in every media: music, books, movies, TV, and even on social media. We seem to hav lost our collective ability, wisdom, and trust on love. We are afraid to talk about love, feeling confused about this subject while silently feels the void in our life and our relationships, as Oscar Wilde aptly put it, "the pain the dares not speak its name."

During the pandemic lockdown, along with the rest of the world, I have moved my social life online, mostly in discussion groups. I started my social experiment to "spread the words on love," I have observed indications of people's carrying this yearning   and are in need of a way to put into words to tell the world about the feelings and the needs that are alive in their heart. On one occasion, during a meetup event about the law of attraction and money, the host surveyed everyone's experience of abundance, I had an epiphany, "when my heart is filled with love," it rings true with reverberations in my mind and struck a chord in  everyone's heart at that meeting. 

My journey started a while ago after a five-year relationship ended, and I came to the realization that I was clueless about love and relationship. I didn't have a role model, or knew someone who seemed to have sound wisdom on this subject. That set me on a personal quest to crack the code of love. Like many of my contemporaries who embarked on their personal journey in search for answers to a burning question, I hit the libraries and bookstores to read voraciously every single title remotely related to the subject of love and relationship. Years went by....

What did I find? A land scape of fragmented theories, ideas, advices, and personal experiences, each touches on a specific aspect of the questions, bundled together they become a background of white noise. My journey was filled with excitements, hopes, confusions, disappointments, dead-ends, and despair the that lead to the resignation that I failed to find a satisfying answer. 

Until...

An accidental encounter with spirituality literature and the concept of Unconditional Love. And a surprised revelation on romantic relationship hidden in the Thomas Hardy's classic novel, "Far from the madding crowd." I made a discovery that almost all world religions and ancient spirituality teachings are founded on the premises of "Love is the answer."
