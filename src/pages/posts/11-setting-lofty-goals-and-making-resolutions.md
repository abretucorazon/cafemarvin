Same old! Same old! At the beginning of every year many people including myself, are eager to turn a page to start afresh, and are excited with setting new goals, or making resolutions for the new year. Most of these goals will never see the daylight, they get quickly forgotten, or abandoned as the usual rythm and routines of everyday life resume after the holidays. This whole shenanigans repeats itself again when the next year comes around. Many people recognized this futile pursuit and resolved to to stop setting goals or making resolutions altogether. Well this year is going to be different. We will explore the cause of the failures with reaching new goals, and two ground-breaking techniques that will turn goal setting on its head and make a dent in this whole process.



This year I am exploring a new whole approach based on the concepts of the book \*"Atomic Habits"\* by James Clear who observed that will-power is a limited resource that quickly gets depleted like a bust of a flame. It is not because of the lofty goals we set, or our character flaws, instead, it is our brute force approach toward accomplishing our goal that results in burnout and quitting. The book proposes an opposite approach that shifts the priority from making progress toward our goals, to the sole focus on creating the habits of making on our goals that we will do day-in and day-out automatically without spending any mental energy. And these new habits can be sustained effortlessly over a long period of months or years.



The next step is to concentrate efforts into continuously refining this system until it becomes a habit like brushing your teeth in the morning that does not require full attention or mental energy or physical efforts. Once this new habit is in place, we have solid foundation to build upon. Now we can shift our focus to making progress toward the goal with many small 1% incremental improvements in productivity through increased efforts and investments of time and resources on top of the continuous refinements of the system. By now you have noticed the central themes of this approach:



\- Everything is tiny: tiny efforts, tiny actions, tiny improvements

\- Total shift of focus away from the goals or producing results and productivity. Instead, the attention is focused on creating a program or process or system that support doing tiny bits of the work with minimal efforts, which will carry on uninterrupted over a long period of time in terms of months and years.

\- This whole campaign is on putting in place a self-sustained process, and let time works in our favor.

\- We are working with energy instead of time. We strive to minimize energy to keep the process going over a long period of time--energy management for sustainability instead of the traditional approach of time management for productivity that aims to maximize results in the shortest time frame.



<br/>



Examples of processes based on "Atomic Habits":



1. Building the habit of working out regularly at the gym begins with every morning, putting on workout gears, driving to the gym, going through the front door then go back to the car and drive home. This tiny workout session is to be repeated over 30 days or until it becomes a habit that happens automatically.



2. Learning to play guitar begins with building the habit to practice everyday. Everyday at a set time, take the guitar out of its case, sit holding it for 5 minutes then put it back into the case. Repeat this process for 30 days.

3. To get back in shape: do one pushup a day for 30 days.



<br/>



Why would this new approach work better?



1. It addresses the pitfalls of the brute-force goal setting that largely underestimates the resources, efforts, and time required to reach a lofty goal. And relying constantly on grit and will power over a long stretch of time often leads to burnout and giving up.

2. It is a personalized system that you set out to design and to continuously refine to keep the ball rolling as effortlessly as possible. This process is designed to fit your style and and your everyday life instead of you having to use will power, expend great energy, and disrupt your life to work toward your goal.

3. It is a gentle beginning then gradually ramping up approach that focuses first building endurance while delaying making progress until endurance becomes fully self-sustaining. Lofty goals require great efforts and long-term commitments, have a better chance to materialize from a slow steady gradual process that sustains endurance like running a marathon versus an all-out 400-meter sprint.

4. The focus on maintaining a high level of energy throughout instead of maximizing results, and to save time. It is a low-stress, healthier, and more enjoyable journey.

\### When failure is welcome



There are times when you find yourself at lost with making progress toward your goal-you have applied this approach, and have refined it in many different ways. You have also made use of brute force, will power and grit to no avail. Chances are you are a head of yourself--your goal belong to the future, and its time has yet to come. Or it might be that your heart is not into this goal and you might have been motivated by an external pressure for a wrong reason. Quit trying, put this goal on a back burner for now, if at some point in the future you hear its calling again then you could choose to resume your pursuit.

\### A vast untapped source of energy



Since our goals are to maintain a high level of energy, and to keep the process alive for a long period of time until it become a second nature. We could use all the sources of energy we could find to fuel our batteries. Besides good nutrition, physical exercise, sleep, and support from family and friends, there is a vast untapped source of energy everyone carries within themselves--is is called Love. You have heard the expression: \*"The power of Love"\* from different sources. Most people do not believe they can tap into this energy to fuel their lives. For beginners:



1. Pursue goals that are dear to your heart.

2. Add Love to the work you do in the pursuit of your goal.

3. Regularly spend time doing something you love even if it is unrelated to your goal. Doing anything you love replenish your energy since Love is regenerative by nature.

4. Spend time with people you love who support you

Mother Teresa said it best:



\> Try not to do great things. \

\> Try to do little things with great love

\### The Unknown keeps all your treasures



Did you know wealth, success, happiness, and every wonderful thing you are aspiring to attain resides in the Unknown awaiting you. In order to find whatever you are seeking you must embrace the unknown and step into the shallow water and slowly advancing toward the deep end. You will also find failures, disappointments, even pains, also reside in the unknown side-by-side with all the goodies. You will experience discomfort, disillusion. Stay on your course, not to be sidetracked, or deterred. These are parts of every journey into the Unknown, they pave the path leading to your treasures.



Jim Carrey's cult-classic movie, "Yes, man" tells a funny and thought-provoking story about boldly jumping both feet into the Unknown. Here is a \[link to the trailer](https://youtu.be/dDh1l3qVNoY)



One more thing to keep in mind while venturing into the Unknown: you will be wrong most of the time. When called to make a choice, everyone relies on information from their past experiences which do not apply in this new territory, that results in many mistakes, failures, and frustrations. Because at first, you don't know that you don't know, and think that you know until after repeated failures and frustrations you come to know that you don't know. Yet, you still don't know what you need to know, you set out to seek until you find what you need to know and learn it then you actually know. Throughout this whole time you are continuously wrong. Be comfortable with that.

There are much more information on putting the concepts in this article into practice, and many tips on making them work specifically for your lifestyle and your personality. You will find worthwhile to review the materials listed here:



\- \*"Atomic Habits,"\* James Clear wrote an accessible introduction to the concepts and benefits of tiny habits, and provides practical advices for putting it into practice. There are inspiring stories of successful implementations by well-known organizations like the British national cycling team. (\[link to a free audiobook version](https://youtu.be/4hHW5SitfH4))

\- \*"Tiny Habits,"\* B. J. Fogg wrote a practical introduction to tiny habits based on his research on Universal Behavior Model at Stanford University. He presents a general structured method to shaping a behavior and forming a habit. Other book on habits are largely based on B. J. Fogg's original research.

Managing Energy instead of time is a profound shift in thinking about productivity. It takes time and some careful consideration to wrap your mind around it. I am still in the process of learning and experimenting with this new approach. You will discover more insights here:



\- In his book, \*"The power of full engagement,"\* Jim Loehr wrote about his work leading to the discovery of managing energy, and the success he obtained from coaching high-performance athletes and business executives. (\[link to a summary video](https://youtu.be/Lsf166_Rd6M))

\- \*"Manage Your Energy, Not Your Time,"\* an article by Harvard Business Review. (\[link](https://hbr.org/2007/10/manage-your-energy-not-your-time?autocomplete=true))

\- \*The Energy Project\* founded by Tony Schwartz, the co-author of "The power of full engagement," trains organizations to implement managing energy inside their company. (\[Tony Schwartz's talk at Tedx](https://youtu.be/smrMWv5rcCo))
