I have been an avid reader of personal development books for a long time. The popular topics in this genre of literature are career-success, relationships, and healing. The grand-daddy in the career-success category is definitely Napoleon Hill with his all-time classic "Think and Grow Rich" that single-handedly created this personal success book industry. Napoleon Hill spent this entire career researching on the secret formula for building wealth, he interviewed extensively  the most  successful self-made industrialists at the time: Andrew Carnegie, Charles Schwab, John D. Rockefeller, Thomas Edison,.... "Think and Grow Rich" is a distillation of this research. In a nutshell, Napoleon Hill concluded that the formula for success is:

success = setting a big goal + a single-minded hyper-focused and relentless pursuit of this goal.

And the premise of his book is that any person can apply this formula and is willing to invest the same amount of mental energy, sweat, and dedication as the 1% successful people did, will find success. This formula for success is still the de-facto standard today. 

Along with millions others, I have applied this formula in several attempts and obtained this result:

burn out = big goal + sustained will power

Sometime ago, I came across a quote by mother Teresa that struck me: 

"Try not to do great things, try little things with great love"

I initially thought of it as a word of a caution about vanity, and an advice on the virtue of humility. Then a "light bulb" in my head flickered a flash of revelation: in her advice, mother Teresa hides in plain sight, a different success formula.

great thing = little thing + great love

This formula suggests to chose a small thing to work on that we are able to give it a mountain of love. In time, this small thing will grow into a great thing ie. a success. 

It seems great love is an essential element overlooked by Napoleon Hill's research.
