I was big fan of personal development books for a long time. The popular topics in this genre of literature are career-success, relationships, and healing. And the grand-daddy in the career-success category is definitely Napoleon Hill with his all-time classic book, "Think and Grow Rich" that single-handedly created this personal success book industry. 

Napoleon Hill spent his entire career researching on the secret formula for building wealth, he interviewed extensively the self-made titans of his time such as, Andrew Carnegie, Charles Schwab, John D. Rockefeller, Thomas Edison,.... "Think and Grow Rich" is the distillation of this research. In a nutshell, Napoleon Hill concluded that the formula for success is:

success = setting a big goal + a single-minded hyper-focused relentless pursuit of this goal.

And the premise of his book is that any person can apply this formula and is willing to invest the same amount of mental energy, sweat, and dedication as the 1% successful people did, will find success. This formula is still the de-facto standard today. 

Along with millions others, I have applied this formula in several attempts and obtained this result:

burn out = big goal + sustained will power

Sometime ago, on a separate personal pursuit entirely unrelated to personal success, I came across a quote by mother Teresa that sticks me: 

"Try not to do great things, try to do little things with great love"

Initially, I understood it as a word of a caution against vanity, and an advice on the virtue of humility. Then the "light bulb" in my head flickered a flash of revelation: in her advice, mother Teresa hides in plain sight, a different success formula:

great thing = little thing + great love

This suggests to chose a small thing to work on that we are able to give it a mountain of love. In time, this small thing will grow into a great thing ie. a success. 

It seems great love is an essential ingredient of success, and this idea opens new doors in my thinking:

*Little things*: make it easy to start with little overhead, and without large upfront investment of efforts, and grow with time. This organic process is an integral part of the natural world.

*Love*: is a renewable energy that replenishes itself from the same work that draws its energy from love. In contrast, will-power borrows energy from the future, depletes a  person's limited reserve, and would drain out all the energy if prolonged over time. 

*Meaning*: is found in the love one feels for the work itself. Something means a lot to a person if they care greatly about it, conversely, when someone does not care about something, that thing has no meaning to them. In short, meaning is not an intrinsic part of an object, meaning is attributed to that object by a person's love.

*Not all rosy*: the path to success is filled with trials and tribulations regardless which road a person chooses to take. Love provides the fuel for the journey, and it does not changes the peaks and valleys of the landscape. There will be times of exhilaration, exhaustion, self-doubt, and despair, that make one wonders is this love or will-power?

*Signs of love*: when in the depth of a valley, a person can still see the value of their work in the importance of its contribution to someone's life. Instead of the greatness of the reward brought upon by the successful completion the work. 
Another sign of love is when a person's creative juice is on overdrive  generating many new ideas, improvements and directions to pursue. 
And there is love if in a moment of exhaustion, when a person has given their last ounce of energy to the work, they can still look back on his efforts and smile.

*Happiness*: happens when your heart, mind, and actions are aligned in the same direction.

Incidentally, while writing this article, I came across an interview of Jim Carrey and his words stick with me: 

"I realized the real chance that you could fail at doing something you hate, you might as well take the risk doing what you love. "
