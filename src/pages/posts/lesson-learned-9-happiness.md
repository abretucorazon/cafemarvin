## Health

Health is time. Good health is a promise of quality time. Like  fresh air and fresh water, most of us are fortunate to enjoy its bounty, and to take for them granted until they runs out that we truly acknowledge their precious value. Health comes in a full spectrum: at level zero, a person has reached their full life expectancy. Moving up the scale is the “clunker” level which is similar to the state of an old car, it works more or less, there is always one problem or another. Next is the “low energy” level where nothing is wrong but overall it is not great either. And so on all the way to the top of the scale where a person is busting with energy and feeling “invincible” like they are standing on top of a mountain after a full ascend. In the midst of the complexity of life, health is the foundation that our whole life is built upon.

<br/>  


## Peace

This is a state of inner peace or peace of mind that  takes place when we achieve a comfortable level of our basic needs for survival, safety, and stability in our everyday. When there is no immediate threat that might compromise these resources, or taking away our basic rights like freedom. And in the absence of a major source of stress or of worries that keeps us awake at night. Like two sides of a same coin, without good health, one can not achieve inner peace, and without inner peace, our health will be slowly eaten away by stress and worries. In short, peace is absolutely essential to maintain good health.

## Joy

Unless someone wants to lead a healthy life contemplating inner peace like that of a Zen master immersed in the serenity at top of some mountain, most of us, common mortals, would become bored and restless, putting our peace of mind seriously at risk. Where is the joy and laughter? The good stuffs of life that make our heart beat  faster, and us feel alive, kicking and thriving? Joy puts motion into our lives so that we are in synch with the world around us that is in perpetual motion at every level, from the expansion of the universe down to the vibration of electrons. Joy incites people to engage in social interactions since most of us tend to have more fun and laughters while in good company, and we tend to rejoice in the collective pursuit of a worthwhile undertaking that is beyond the reach for a single person’s ability.



<br/>  


## Love
  
Love gives a meaning to our life and along with it brings the greatest joy of all. Love is a force of nature that moves mountains, makes the impossible possible, launches humanity forward. A mystery of life that holds a promise of wisdom and enlightenment. It is a natural evolution between people who rejoice in each other’s company in the pursuit of a common vision.

## A balancing act

Four stepping stones: Health, Peace, Joy, Love, each builds upon its precedent, and yet, they are often not on a straight path from the bottom to the top. Our lives are in contant motion, we are being constantly stirred up and down in the whirlwinds. Our health, peace, joy and love are in flux between peaks and valleys with the events in our lives. It is a responsibility to oneself to tend to these cornerstones of our lives. At times, when working to revive any one of these four areas, it can be easier to take a step backward to start with the previous area, and work our way forward. For example, when Love is lost, let’s work on finding Joy and laughter in the company of close friends. When all Joy is lost, it would be wise to take a step back to focus on Peace, to tend to our basic needs and putting our house back in good order before seeking Joy. And Health is forever the quintessential starting point to rebuild a life.
