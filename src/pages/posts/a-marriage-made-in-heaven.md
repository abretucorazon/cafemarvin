Greetings,

Over the Christmas holidays I managed to finish reading Steve Jobs’ biography, it reminded me of Victor Frankl’s classic book: “Man in Search of Meaning.” Victor Frankl was an Austrian psychologist who championed the concept that people have a deep emotional need to find meaning out of their life, it is the source of fulfillment and satisfaction that makes all the efforts and hardship of the journey feel worthwhile.

Steve Jobs rephrased this concept in a different way in his 2005 Commencement speech at Stanford university: “Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don’t settle.“

To paraphrase Steve: "Don’t do what you like, or dislike! Do what you think is really important to the world and to yourself! Do the work you Love and Care Deeply, it will bring Meaning to your life.” If you are unsure whether the work you are doing is meaningful, a sure indication is when you are on a personal life Mission.

*MONEY* is the other essential outcome of the work we do. Money provides the necessary support for our lives and for the lives of people we love. And money is absolutely needed to support our work.

And together **“Meaning & Money”** are united in a Marriage Made-in-Heaven.

But in life we are often faced with questions like these: “Meaning or Money, which comes first?” Or, “If I could only pick one, which one should it be?”

Neither Meaning nor Money could sustain by itself alone, the same way Black & White, Day & Night, Yin & Yang are inseparable by nature. Meaning & Money must both be parts of our plans., if either one is neglected, overtime, it is very hard to catch up for lost time, and the one “M” we chose to focus on will eventually stop making sense in the absence of the other.

But there would be time when we are forced by circumstances to pick one, it would be a wiser bet in favour of “Meaning first, Money later”–society will serve as a constant reminder of our financial obligations. On the other hand, if we had decided to focus on Money first, there is simply no equivalent source of insistent reminder to steer us back on the right path–Money alone has a way of making people do the things they don’t want to do.

There you have it:
