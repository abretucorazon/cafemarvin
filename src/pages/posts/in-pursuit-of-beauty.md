It is interesting to observe an absent culture of aesthetic in everyday's life. Somewhere along the way this European heritage got lost in its ocean crossing, or in the shuffle of time, or replaced by the pursuit of efficiency. In recent history, aesthetic was reserved for a small exclusive club composed of artists, poets, designers, and architects. And then one day, Steve Jobs came along and championed the culture of Beauty as an essential part of everyday life. Over night, the engineering and business communities step up to embrace beautiful design as an integral component of the computer industry. 

Beauty, according to Steve, is more than just looking pretty. Beauty encompasses depth, simplicity, balance and harmony. It is a difficult task to explain Beauty, or to understand it intellectually–Beauty has to be experienced in order to be appreciated. Its presence can be felt in nature, in a child’s smile, in Arts, and in well-designed products.

Why bother to pursue Beauty at all in the first place? Because, while knowledge feeds the mind, the heart yearns for Beauty. Without which, Love would not be possible.
