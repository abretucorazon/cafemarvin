Change is intrinsic to human nature: a manifestation of evolution. It has been said that one meaning of life is to help moving humanity forward, and each person contributes to this grand scheme with their own personal evolution–drawing a parallel to Thich-Nhat-Hanh’s teaching: “*One way to achieve World Peace is for each person to achieve inner peace.*”

Many of us want to change, or improve some aspect of our lives such as fitness, or relationship, or career, …, it is an ongoing process of our personal evolution. And while some succeed in attaining their goal, others feel increasingly exasperated and helpless from repeated attempts; then arises the pervasive sense of being stuck in a rut with no way out. Well, this article attempts to shine some light in this dark tunnel that does not turn out to be the headlight of a train coming right at you. Are you ready for this Secret Art of Change? – “**Continuous Learning.**"

Everyone tends to agree on some abstract level that learning is a powerful mean for personal transformation, except it doesn’t seem to work in practice. This is a similar case to the early life of young Luke Skywalker, a descendant of a long line of Jedi knights who are masters at the use of "The Force” to combat evils, except for young uninitiated Luke Skywalker himself. Below are a few tips that should help everyone to tame “The Force for Change.” I reason when learning fails in practice, it is often due to an impersonal choice of subject that might be popular at the moment, or some authority had decided it is a subject everyone needs to learn regardless of their personal interest. I trust the following tips will make learning enjoyable and empowering for all:



* **Learn the things that will make your life more beautiful**\
  for examples, learn to dress well, learn about fine food, interior design to make your living quarter more beautiful, to speak and write beautifully (poetry, for example, is the fine art of language.) Keep in mind that “Beautiful is more than just looking pretty,” as Steve Jobs once explained about everything Apple does has to be beautiful. Beauty also includes substance, depth, and truth.
* **Learn the things that will make your heart sing** flower arrangement, riding a motorcycle, eastern religions, etc…, anything under the sun that your heart fancies. Learning can feed the heart as much as it feeds the mind–a fact overlooked by an education system that is overly focused on cultivating the mind, resulting in an emotionally unfulfilled society. As with the things that make your life more beautiful, things that make your heart sing will uplift your spirit, inspire your imagination, and build up your self-confidence.
* **Learn about relationship building** research in sociology, neurology and business management have slowly converged to the conclusion that people are healthier, happier, live longer, and are more successful when they are in good relationship with their family, friends, and associates. Of all knowledge under the sun, relationship building and communication skills represent the best investment of one’s time and effort, and its reward will continue on for several generations. This knowledge will not go obsolete in any foreseen future as history has shown that human nature have remained essentially unchanged for thousands of years while everything else around us has been changing at an increasingly faster pace. Coincidentally, I came across an age-old secret: reading novels as an effective, effortless and enjoyable way to learn about relationship and social skills. It has been scientifically confirmed by Brain Researchers and recently revealed to the Business community in this article on the Harvard Business Review website, “[The Business Case for Reading Novels](http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/01/the_business_case_for_reading.html) ."
* **Learn a thing or two from everyone**\
  Ralph Waldo Emerson once said: “*In my walks, every man I meet is my superior in some way, and in that I learn from him.*” This philosophy opens up an inexhaustive source of learning that have many more advantages: it is readily accessible and inexpensive as people are generally willing to share their knowledge to anyone eager to learn. Furthermore, asking someone to teach you what they know is, if not, the most heart-felt sincere form of compliment for someone’s quality–and it is also an excellent practice for relationship building. On the flip side, teaching another person one’s skill is a new opportunity to reexamine and to gain a deeper insight into that knowledge, therefore, be happy to return the favour by teaching anyone who sincerely wishes to learn from us. 
* **Learn by Discovery**learning is not limited to the classroom, it can take place anywhere in any form: a new hobby, for example, is an fun way of learning something new and interesting. Google is well-known for encouraging its engineers to spend 20% of their time at work to explore a personal idea. This policy has been the catalyst behind some of Google products including Gmail, Google news reader, and the Go programming language. Learning by discovery is a self-directed process, by researching and exploring through trials and errors until we arrive at the discovery then the lesson is learned. It is an exhilarating personal adventure into the unknown that stretches one’s imagination and creativity.

In the end you may wonder how do the above suggestions bring upon the elusive changes you have sought after? These suggestions may bring upon your life the changes you are*not*looking for, however, they will succeed in significantly enhancing the overall quality of your life. As people focus on accumulating many new knowledge and skills, in time, they will look back and find their life transformed by their new knowledge. This continuous learning process will help anyone to unstuck themselves, and to build up their confidence that they can change. They can then turn around to reapply this learning process into achieving the changes they originally set their mind on. Here is an example of applying learning to weight control: learning about Nutrition is an essential part of achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight, learning about physical exercise, quality food, cooking, and the negative effect of sitting for an extended period of time, are the remaining ingredients to complete the process.

Finally, I would like to leave you with this thought about ‘change’, 'being stuck’, and 'learning’:

and a gentle reminder that “The best time to plant a tree is …”
