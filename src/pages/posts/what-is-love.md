The pandemic had a life-changing impact on many people around the world, out of my own struggles during the lockdown came a breakthrough in my quest to crack the code of love. I discovered Sufism, an ancient  religion founded on love: God is love. Love created the world. God is in everyone and everything--Love is in everyone and everything. I made a final leap from self-help psychology into the world of spirituality after a realization that all spirituality teachings since the dawn of time are all about love, there is a rich body of wisdom and teaching on the mystery of love that modern psychology has just begun to draw from. This is a sequel to my previous account on my journey to crack to code of love ([link to "I love you" article](https://www.146verdi.com/posts/i-love-you-work-in-progress/)) In that article I promised to share the lessons learned about Unconditional Love, I hope to fulfill that promise here.

### Michael Singer's definition of love

Michael Singer is an American spiritual teacher based in Gainville, Florida [(website)](tou.org). His book, "The untethered soul" has largely inspired me to dive into the ocean of spirituality. I am sumarizing roughly the lesson I learned about love from his teaching here:

Love is an immense source of energy, a universal life force that runs deep within everyone's heart, and it longs to reach out to connect with the love in other people's hearts. To love is simply to keep our heart open to everyone and everything in our lives. Spiritual teaching revolves around connecting our mind with this love within ourself and to look at life from the  perspective of this love. And Love hurts at times. It takes courage to love unconditionally without controlling or possession. It is easier to dwell in fear and resentments and perpetuate suffering. As a wise person once said, "pain is unavoidable, suffering is up-to-you." Like a snake bite that hurts but is harmless, it is the poison that lingers in our body that turns out to be fatal.

For many years,  I went out into the world, in search for “The Love of my life.” To my amazement, I learned that The Love *of* my life is not out there. And it is not a person. It is the Love *for* my life I carry within me.

   >Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it.
>
>        - Rumi

Fear erects walls that trap and bury love deep in the depth the subconscious. Our minds are conditioned, trained, educated to embrace fear as the guiding force for navigating throu life. Our conscious minds are addicted to fear. Fear permeates all our thoughts, beliefs, and values. Fears become the backdrop of every aspect of our lives in various shapes and sizes like anxieties, worries, resentment, anger, restlessness, loneliness, hatred, guilt, shame, .... Once in many moons, we come across a person that triggers our heart to open and we can feel love swelling up in our heart. We confound that person to be the source of love that fills up our hearts and declare that we have found "The Love of our life." We actually mistake the person that rubbed the magic lamp and let the genie out, to be the genie himself. We became dependent and possessive for fear of loosing the person that is able to trigger our hearts to open for us to feel love. We resort to every possible strategy to keep this person for ourself. Seduction, deceit, manipulation, promises of our undying love, baits like fame, money, attention, sex, affection, power, excitment, the moon, or the world,....

We plead, beg, threaten, guilt, shame, or force their loyalty. We promise everything except one, their freedom to leave. Hence, the age old saying: "If you truly love someone, set them free." The great wisdom of spiritual teachings can be loosely described as there is a benevolent and mighty genie name "Love" who is trapped by Fear in a magic lamp that is our heart. We can learn to rub our own magic lamp to free the genie. We can learn to open our heart to unleash this universal love into our life. 

This Love as a mighty immense source of energy that lives within everyone is a difficult concept that takes a quantum leap to wrap our mind around. It is the Tao in Taoism, God in Christianity, Sufism and Islam. And  Compassion in Budhism. Did you know what "Aloha" means in Hawaiian language? It means,   "In the presence of Divinity"

   > Keep breaking your heart until it opens
>
 >        - Rumi

Spiritual teachings ask us to listen to our heart because it is believed that the mind was not designed to understand love. Love is to be experienced to be known, it can not be explained, or understood intellectually. I can try to offer a modest example in the experience of abundance. We experience abundance when our heart is filled with love-we become selfless, generous, and forgiving. Otherwise, we would feel fearful in our heart, and lacking in our life regardless the size of our material wealth, it will never feel enough. 


   > Love is a sea where the intellect drowns
   >
>        - Rumi

    
  
On my journey to reconnect with this universal love from within I am learning and practicing Self-love, Meditation, and Spirituality:

### Self-love

Love yourself to experience and understand what love is, and know how to love another person. If you don't love yourself: no one would be able to love you, your heart is closed to all the love in the world. And you would not have the first-hand knowledge of what to do to love another person when your heart is clouded in fear.

The quality of a person's life is a reflection of what is alive within themself. When there are joy and love in their life, it is a result of the Joy and Love in their inner-world.

What do you do to to love yourself?
One of my favourite spiritual teacher, Louise Hay, spent her career teaching people the following process to love themselves:

- Stop criticizing, judging, or blaming yourself
- Take care of your health: nutrition, sleep, exercise, supportive relationships
- Accept yourself as you are, with all your qualities and flaws
- Be kind and cherish yourself
- Be patient with yourself
- Forgive yourself for all the mistakes you made
- Stop scaring yourself with worries about the future
- Find support from your close relationships when you need help
- Practice meditation to connect with your true self   
  

### Meditation

Meditation has gained a wider audience in recent years. It helps many to turn inward to listen to their body, to their emotions, and to reconnect with the personal truth in their heart unclouded by the distractions of the outside world.

While self-love helps to release the grip of fear that represses love deep down into our subconscious. Like in the story of the magic lamp, a powerful force trapped the genie inside the magic lamp. In parallel, meditation helps to reach inside the lamp to reconnect with the genie.

### Spirituality teachings

Thanks to Youtube's recommendation algorithm, I discovered spiritual teachings that put me on a new path, out of my confusion and my aimless wandering in the self-help world. These teachings came from different teachers from different cultures and different parts of the world--the underlying wisdom remains the same: to connect with this universal love we all carry within our heart. 

I invite everyone to look at spirituality teachings as models of your emotions and your relationships in life. The same way Newton's laws and Einstein's theory of relativity are models of the physical world. The difference with spirituality is it can not be understood intellectually, instead, it can only be experienced by trying out the teaching in your daily life to discover its magic. I think what drove people away from spirituality was, in part, the mis-interpretation of spirituality by organized religeous institutions to maintain power over the people. As an example, you might be interested in a re-interpretation of Christianity in "A course in Miracle" listed below. The other factor is the advancements of science and technology that have had great success in elevating the standard of living, and became the new religion with its own churches. Yet, the world has reached a point in time where the need for Love can be felt globally since science and technology are not equiped to elevate our collective consciousness, or our relationships with one another and between communities.

I am listing below some of the teaching materials that are the corner stones of my journey so far:

- [Michael Singer's "The untethered life"](https://untetheredsoul.com/untethered-soul)
- [Ellif Shefak's "The forty rules of love" ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Forty_Rules_of_Love)
- [Louise Hay's "You can heal yourself"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Can_Heal_Your_Life) 
- ["A course in Miracle"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Course_in_Miracles) 
- [Dr. Joe Dispenza's "Breaking the habit of being yourself"](https://medium.com/the-write-purpose/how-to-transform-your-life-breaking-the-habit-of-being-yourself-by-joe-dispenza-bfbfa380e449)
- [Ram Dass' lectures](https://www.ramdass.org/love-compassion/#love-compassion-videos) 
- [Marshall Rosenberg's "Nonviolent communication"](https://www.nonviolentcommunication.com) 


The first line of the Dao De Jing which is the bible of Taoism says: *"A Tao that may be spoken is not the enduring Tao."* I take this to be loosely the equivalent what Rumi said: *"Love is a sea where the intellect drowns."*...
Have I drowned your intellect in this article? I took on the impossible task of depicting Love, or speaking about the Tao in a few hundreds words. It is 0.1% of the tip of an  iceberg of infinit size. If this article stirs in you a little curiosity, I proclaim my resounding success. 

I am leaving you with this little fun fact: going around talking about Love is a health-hazardous activity, here is what happened to three folks in this business: one got nailed on a cross, a second had a dream and got shot, the third said "All you need is love" and you know what happened....

    
>    "Love is life. All, everything that I understand, I understand only because I love. Everything is, everything exists, only because I love. Everything is united by it alone. Love is God, and to die means that I, a particle of love, shall return to the general and eternal source."
>
>       - Leo Tolstoy
