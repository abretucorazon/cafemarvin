*“If a tree falls down in the forrest and there is no one there, does it make a sound?”*

This proverbial question had kept me puzzled for many years in my early childhood. One day, I finally came up with this answer: “*It does not make any difference whether a sound was made or not since no one is there to hear*.” Incidentally, this article is about Listening.

It has been said, then popularized, and then repeated over and over again in popular culture that the essential key ingredient for a happy relationship is Listening skill. Pop Psychology/Self-Help literature has spilled so much ink in the process of turning this topic into a commercial franchise without accomplishing an observable improvement in the lives of their readers who are earnest in their quest to strengthen the bond of their relationship.\[[MORE]]

For a long long time, I was among these faithful seekers of this elusive “secret” essential to all interactions with loved ones in everyday life. It has been said somewhere that the best way to hide something is to put it right in front of everybody in such a way that no one notice it. It was both a source of frustration and of motivation during all that time searching in the dark, then one day, it dawned on me that there is no earth-shattering secret, the answer is so simple that every young child knows and does so well. It has been right in front of the world since the beginning of time, and I was just beginning to notice.

**The ultimate thing to listen for isnotwords or ideas**

Around the world, the first thing people say to one another upon their meeting is an equivalence of “Hello” in their own language. And what is the next thing people say to one another after “Hello”?… “How are you?”, "Comment ça va?,“ "Ni hao?,” “¿Cómo estás,” etc…. These questions are meant to inquire about the*emotional state*of the other person. Unfortunately, the meaning of these inquiries was lost through the ages and these inquiries became a mere social custom.*“How are you feeling at the moment?”* was intended to be an inquiry for the first and foremost piece of information that will dictate the tone and the direction for the entire conversation.<p> <strong> </br> </strong> </p>

**An essential outcome of a conversation with a dear one.**

Adults are not much different from children in their conversation with a loved one. Imagine you are having a conversation with a child, what would you want her to take away from this exchange? Advice? Wisdom? Encouragement? Perhaps…, yet, ultimately, you would want the child to walk away from the conversation feeling that she has*been heard*and that she feels better about herself than prior to the conversation. People often engage in a conversation to obtain validation for their ideas, or opinions, or actions which, as listeners, we may not always agree with or approve of. The only truly sincere gift we could offer to loved ones is a validation of their feelings which, to my knowledge, is probably the only Absolute Unquestionable Truth there is under the sun. It’s nearly, if not, impossible to doubt, or deny the truthfulness of a person’s feelings, they are neither right or wrong, good or bad–they just exist. Meanwhile, ideas, opinions, and actions could be either right or wrong, true or false, good or bad–it is a matter of point of view. Offering to acknowledge and to validate someone’s feelings is a sincere and truthful celebration of their being without passing judgements. <p> <strong> </br> </strong> </p>



**Listen with your eyes**

It has been said the eyes are a window into the soul. To listen to someone with our eyes is a great way to tune in to that person’s emotional state, its ebbs and tides throughout the conversation. Words can obscure or even betray emotions, yet, facial expressions are more faithful in conveying true feelings. To stay tuned to another person’s emotional state forms a foundation for*tactfulness–*it safeguards against inadvertently trampling on people’s feelings during the exchange. As in a dance, I will speak in synch with the other person’s readiness to listen, and conversely, be listening in synch with the other person’s readiness to speak.<p> <strong> </br> </strong> </p>



**Listen more than you speak**

I read somewhere that God gave humans two ears but only one mouth so that we would be listening twice as much as we speak. An interesting idea that is rather hard to do in practice, for one, if everyone competes to listen then nobody would hardly speaks and we would be spending a great deal of time in company of each other in complete silence. My take on this idea is to make sure that 50% of what I say in a conversation are inquiries–the type of questions that ask for clarifications, elaborations, feedbacks, or motivations behind people’s ideas, opinions, actions, or feelings. Then I make sure that I take the time to listen to their answers.<p> <strong> </br> </strong> </p>



**Listen to yourself**

As much as the trees in the forrest would not wish to fall down when there is no one there to hear the sound of their passings, you and I would want to be there to witness the trees falling. However, there are times when we are not ready or fit for such an excursion into the forrest then the trees will have to wait. Staying tuned to our own feelings during the conversation, as much as we strive to tune into the other person’s feelings, is meant to maintain the balance in the flow of the conversation. If it happens that we are not in an emotional state to be receptive as a listener then it is best to excuse ourselves and to reschedule the conversation at later time. In short, we can truly listen such that loved ones will feel they have been heard when we are fully emotionally present.

To listen such that loved ones feel they have been heard is like to love them such that they feel being loved. It takes great skills and great efforts which make it a great gift to bestow upon precious dear ones. And while love can be many different things for different people, for one…
