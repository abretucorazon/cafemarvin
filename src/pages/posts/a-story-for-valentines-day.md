<p style="margin-left:45%; margin-right:20%;">MENDEL</p>

<p style="margin-left:45%; margin-right:20%;">MARIA</p>

<p style="margin-left:45%; margin-right:20%;">MENDEL</p>

<p style="margin-left:40%; margin-right:20%;">(looking straight into her eyes) 

<p style="margin-left:30%; margin-right:20%;">When I was about to be born…

INT. HEAVEN – DAY (SOMEWHERE UP IN HEAVEN)

ANGELS and CUPIDS are preparing souls to be born on earth. An old SAINT with long white hair and white beard is busy behind piles of thick and large books of different kinds.

<p style="margin-left:45%; margin-right:20%;">OLD SAINT</p>

It is time for the next soul to be brought to earth. 

A cupid shoots an arrow upward at a distant cloud setting off a chain of lightning and thunder. Lightning strikes a cloud covering the ground, Mendel slowly emerges from behind the cloud turbulence. He is tall, young, and handsome. His eyes are sleepy, unfocused.

Another cupid takes his hand to lead him toward the old Saint who is scribing in his large registry book. The old Saint takes a good look at Mendel then points toward a large mirror 

<p style="margin-left:45%; margin-right:20%;">OLD SAINT</p>

<p style="margin-left:30%; margin-right:20%;">You are about to be born into this family.

The mirror shows a young couple on their wedding day. 

<p style="margin-left:45%; margin-right:20%;">OLD SAINT (V.O.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:30%; margin-right:20%;">These are your parents.

The mirror shows the wife in labor, and the husband sitting restlessly in a hallway. 

<p style="margin-left:45%; margin-right:20%;">OLD SAINT (V.O.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:30%; margin-right:20%;">You will grow into a handsome and wealthy gentleman. You will be adored by the ladies.

The mirror shows Mendel in different luxurious settings, each time with a different beautiful girl in his arm. 

<p style="margin-left:45%; margin-right:20%;">OLD SAINT (V.O.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:30%; margin-right:20%;">However, your will marry a short, unattractive girl with a hunched back. 

The mirror shows Mendel walking down the aisle on his wedding day with his short hunched-back bride by his side. 

Mendel slowly wakes up from his sleepiness. A beautiful angel comes over to lead him away. She looks very much like Maria. He resists, not wanting to leave. He tries to speak but no sound comes out of his mouth. He points a finger at his future bride in the mirror and looks intensely at the old Saint. Mendel shakes his head, tears roll down his cheeks. The old Saint is surprised. 

Mendel turns to point at the beautiful angel standing next to him, then moves his finger to point at his future bride in the mirror, and looks inquiringly at the old Saint who pauses to consider then searches through his large volumes. He looks up at Mendel and shakes his head. The beautiful angel again leads him away. Mendel stares intensely at the mirror as he steps away. 

Abruptly, Mendel grabs the angel’s hand and pulls her back in front of the mirror. He points at his future bride then points at his back and gestures to indicate him shorter. 

The old Saint ponders, flips through a few pages of his books, then picks up his pen to write in his registry. 

The mirror now shows Mendel short and hunched-back like his bride. 

Mendel pulls the angel forward by her hand, he points at her then at his future bride in the mirror. The old Saint smiles sympathetically, he picks up his pen and makes a quick change in the registry. The mirror now shows the beautiful Angel as his bride. It makes her smile. Mendel smiles through his tears, he moves his lips to say thank you to the old Saint then turns to take a long last look at the mirror as the beautiful angel leads him toward the Birth Area. 

The Angel’s look lingers on Mendel. Their eyes lock. Thick white clouds quickly build up around Mendel, and he finally disappears behind the clouds. There is an echo of a distant thunder. 

<p style="margin-left:45%; margin-right:20%;">MENDEL (V.O.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:30%; margin-right:20%;">…And then I was born.

The mirror shows Mendel’s mother gave birth to the baby.

The Angel gazes into the dispersing clouds that have just taken Mendel away.

EXT. IN THE PARK – DAY (RESUME FROM THE SAME EARLIER SCENE)

Maria looks intensely at Mendel with teary eyes. Mendel awaits her reaction. There is a silent moment. 

Maria slowly holds out her hand. With a great effort, Mendel moves to take her hand.

INT. MARIA’S MUSIC ROOM - DAY

Mendel and Maria are sitting side by side at her piano. She is playing from the music sheet with concentration. He listens and follows attentively the music on the partition. He holds the tip of the page with one hand. She nods. He eagerly turns the page. She smiles without interrupting her playing, then bows her head against his shoulder. He smiles and wraps his arm around her waist.

INT. LIVING ROOM – DAY

Lord Byron watches Mendel and Maria sitting at the piano in the next room through a small secret view port that cuts through the wall. He stops watching and smiles approvingly. 

EXT./INT. HEAVEN - DAY

Everyone is watching Mendel and Maria sitting at the piano from the mirror. Two cupids embrace each other cheek-to-cheek smiling happily. The Old Saint smiles with satisfaction, he raises his pen to make some note in his registry. The cupids join hand to form a circle around the Beautiful Angel, they dance around her and sing a children song. The Angel smiles then joins in the circle to sing and dance. 

Lightning and the clouds above their head lights up with warm colors. A chorus of sacred music comes down from above. Everyone stops and looks up above their head, captivated by the music. 

<p style="margin-left:45%; margin-right:20%;">POWERFUL VOICE(O.S.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:40%; margin-right:20%;">(lightning flashes)

<p style="margin-left:30%; margin-right:20%;">WELL DONE! </p>

The music fades out. 

<p style="margin-left:45%; margin-right:20%;">THE OLD SAINT </p>

<p style="margin-left:40%; margin-right:20%;">(claps his hands a few times)

 <p style="margin-left:30%; margin-right:20%;">It is time for the next soul to be born.

Another cupid fires his arrow. There are lightning and thunders. Behind the dispersing clouds, the old midwife appears, her eyes are half asleep.

<div align="right";>FADE OUT. </div>

<br><br><br><p style="margin-left:45%; margin-right:20%;">THE END </p>
