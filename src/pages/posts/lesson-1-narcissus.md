The prologue for Paulo Coelho's novel "The Alchemist" goes as follows: 

"The alchemist picked up a book that someone in the caravan had brought. Leafing through the pages, he found a story about Narcissus.

The alchemist knew the legend of Narcissus, a youth who knelt daily beside a lake to contemplate his own beauty. He was so fascinated by himself that, one morning, he fell into the lake and drowned. At the spot where he fell, a flower was born, which was called the narcissus.

But this was not how Oscar Wilde, the author of the book, ended the story.

He said that when Narcissus died, the goddesses of the forest appeared and found the lake, which had been fresh water, transformed into a lake of salty tears.

“Why do you weep?” the goddesses asked.

“I weep for Narcissus,” the lake replied.

“Ah, it is no surprise that you weep for Narcissus,” they said, “for though we always pursued him in the forest, you alone could contemplate his beauty close at hand.”

“But…was Narcissus beautiful?” the lake asked.

“Who better than you to know that?” the goddesses said in wonder. “After all, it was by your banks that he knelt each day to contemplate himself!”

The lake was silent for some time. Finally, it said:

“I weep for Narcissus, but I never noticed that Narcissus was beautiful.
“I weep because, each time he knelt beside my banks, I could see, in the depths of his eyes, my own beauty reflected.”

“What a lovely story,” the alchemist thought."

Over my last birthday, someone asked me what was my birthday wish. I thought about it for a moment and said:



"My wish is to love well."



Then other people in the group started their questions: "What do you mean?", "Love well is to love selectively, or love a lot anyone?," "Define it for me?"



This is what I mean:



"To love well is when the people you love \*feel\* loved, heard, understood. In time, your love helps them grow stronger, more confident and happier."



To love well is a \*personal\* skill that takes training and practice. For beginners, practice speaking the five love languages is a great start.

The story Narcissus and the lake depicts the state of "being loved well."



When you love well, your beloved sees their own beauty reflected back to them in your eyes.



In this story, Narcissus and the lake, both, saw their own beauty reflected back to them when they gazed into each other's eyes....
